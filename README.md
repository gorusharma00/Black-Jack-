# Blackjack Game

This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the popular casino card game, Blackjack, using Python.

## Game Rules

The goal of Blackjack is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game is played against a dealer, who follows a specific set of rules for drawing additional cards. The player is dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand). The game continues until either the player or the dealer reaches a hand value of 21 or goes over it.
